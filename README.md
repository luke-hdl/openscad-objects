# openscad-objects
Miscellaenous OpenSCAD objects I've made here and there. None of these are particularly unique or memorable, and there's not too many of them; still, I figured I'd put them out there for anyone who might need something along their lines. 

# Models

## dot-grid-stencil
This is a stencil for a 0.5cm dot grid. I modeled it for sashiko; I struggle with evenly spacing my stitches, and it's annoying to juggle a million stencils. Of course, many motifs can't easily be made with just a dot grid, but many traditional motifs can (e.g., persimmons or double-bars.) Plus, it leaves more room for creativity on my part and developing my own designs.

## number-wheel
This is a wheel with different numbers on it. The intent was to make a sort of fidget-spinner-dice-setup with it, but I never got around to actually working that out. Still, it's an interesting example of using text in OpenSCAD? 

## stitch-on-hook-closure
This is a hook closure you can stitch on to something. Sort of an alternative to a zipper or button. It's less practical than either of those, but it's novel! Works best in TPU, annoying print to clean up.

## gamesir-x2-joystick-cap
This is a replacement joystick cap for the Gamesir X2 game controller. Pops right over the original one. Print in TPU only, if you'r printing it. 

## rectangular-case-generic
Generic rectangular case. Adjust the size and cut windows as-needed for your Digimon V-Pet or whatever. 

## jar-kratky-netcup-holder
Netcup holder for 2-inch/"wide mouth" jars. Use it to grow hydroponic herbs. Be warned that just using a clear glass jar, you're gonna get mold. 

## weaving-tablet
A tablet used for weaving belts, straps, and decorative edges. Use it with your inkle loom. Insistently use it with your rigid heddle loom. Use it how you please.
